Concerns:
* We might find it difficult to create questions for our querying that have sufficient complexity for the difficulty level this project expects.


Issues Encountered:
* Unable to utilize relative pathways for importing data files to our database in DbVisualizer. Instead, we are able to successfully import data using an absolute pathway.


Note:
* We let SQL automatically truncate the “B” (for billions) or “%” (for change %) at the end of a number, which resulted in some warnings.
